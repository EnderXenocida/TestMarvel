# TestMarvel

## Description
Create an iOS application in Swift that communicates with the Marvel API and
meets the following requirements:
* As a user I want to retrieve marvelâ€™s characters and show them in a
list (table, collection or whatever you want).
* As a user I want to see more information about the character in a new
screen (name, description and thumbnail).
* As a user I want to persist and show a
character as a favorite. (in character detail or in
another view)

## Comments
* I have unsed MVVM with protocols.
* I have used Alamorire and AlamofireImages pods.
* I have spent 8 hours to make this test.
* There are unit tests samples.
* Please, remember that this is a test.
